## Restaurant Menu and Online food Booking Description

This Restaurant Menu pack is made using React. The data on the menu is directly linked to a Zomato.com. Any changes to the menu can be made in the code. The changes will then be reflected on to the manu page. This allows you to customize your own personal manu page that can be used for applying to jobs or other personal uses.

## 1. Make sure you have NODE installed!

Firstly, you will need to download the latest version of Node by <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">CLICKING HERE</a>
